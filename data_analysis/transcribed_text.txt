Let's see if the audio is going to start. So now I'll see you after that. Okay. Okay. It decides to welcome to the agreement. Yeah. And is there a plumbing up window saying like something like a gesture or eyes? Uh, follow the upcoming instructions complete the i-collaboration. Yeah. Is there a window for i-collaboration? No, ready. Uh, I don't think so. Okay. I'll try to live it. And uh, right now. Oh, okay. Now I see red. Uh, this is a light orange. Yeah. Maybe I'm not. Sometimes it's just beautiful. No, no, sometimes it just didn't pump up. Okay. Let's try it again. So should it, okay. There's a just. I don't, I don't see the just. Uh, okay. I see star exit debug and then normal. Yeah. Should it look something like that? Yeah. Should it look somewhere else? Uh, no, ours. We can't just do a star. Okay. We'll wait a minute. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm going to take it off. And start at the heck of just an only mess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, it's quite noisy recently. Yeah. A lot of construction is happening on it. Yeah. Yeah. It's a crap noise, but we have nothing to do with it. Yeah. It's a crap noise, but we have nothing to do with it. And run high calibration. And run high calibration. All right. Yeah. Let's see the balls. Yes. Next. Next. Next. Next. Yeah. Make sure now hold your head still and follow the gems with your eyes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How is that? The yellow lens is calibrated. You can always make changes in settings if something doesn't look right. Okay, I think I can open off. Yeah, it's calibrated. Yeah. And normally there should be a automatically pumping up window, but sometimes it doesn't happen. So I will open the application again. It's here. And again when logos make changes are not ready yet. Yep. Left. I am ready Ok I have some issues to overcome I have some issues to overcome Gestural voice What should I say? First the condition is the voice Ok, and for your walking So let's come here Yes Yes For your hands, please Yes, in the cross With hands? No, no, you are sorry Yes, sorry So in the first condition I want to be a very short instruction You will have three hands Walk forward, rotate left Rotate right And you will see this mount later Also in your Poland UI And after a month's drive You will see a pumping up window Ok And you can also hear a beat After the command is finished And you can give the next command Ok Shoshilik voice now? Yes, now you can click the voice And start the trial Yes, I see So walk forward Rotate right Walk forward Oh, it's free walking Oh, ok, ok Rotate left Walk forward Walk forward Rotate left Walk forward Rotate left Walk forward Rotate right Walk forward Rotate right Walk forward Rotate left Walk forward Rotate left Walk forward Walk forward Rotate left Walk forward Rotate right Walk forward Now you can keep wearing polo hands Ok And to go to the voice off Oh Oh, that's a good one Do you remember the gesture?

Gesture? How free one is? And now I have to give you a short instruction Where we start? Where we start? There are still 3 commands for the gestures This is working forward On my... Can you see your hands getting in your fingers? Yours? Mine? Mine I can see yours? To give it visible in the distance This is rotate left Good As flat as possible And this is rotate right If you feel not easy to do it, you can bend your arm Your elbow Try to make the hand visible in the bones And after each gesture, you should go back to the neutral pose This is something similar to the silent teeth If you feel ready, you can silence Okay Oh yeah, yeah, sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Forget it I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry ???? ????

Yeah, you can get it over there. Yeah, sure. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You get to go in and then... Oh, yeah. Perfect. Uh... Five. Five. Four. Four. Zero. Okay. So we're going to have the last condition, which is stationary and gesture. It's time you... Yeah. And... Go start. Yeah. If you're ready, you can start. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah Bai. Five. Five. This was slightly better than the other one standing still, but still a two. Yeah. And zero. zero. Okay, before we... Yeah. Acid. There's a fashion. Yep. So, the four trials you have just performed, what's your favorite one and what's your least favorite one and explain why and you can do this in five seconds. Okay, I think the free walking with voice is probably easiest but that's because the hand gestures need to be very specific so you need to really... Yeah, it doesn't feel natural to move your hand all the way like that. Yeah. And the worst one, right? I think the... the last one was less... I think both standing still is less intuitive and feels worse. Mainly because... Well, it's counter-intuitive to point left or turn left when you go to the right in your visual space. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Thank you. We can't take off the phones. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Stop recording.
